An overview of projects I worked on:
- Rooster Project: Generating a work-schedule using optimization techniques. (this was in scope with my work at the VU, where I Coordinated a team and had to do a lot of scheduling) .Worked on this in my free time.
- Vicszek Boids Model - Complex Systems: A part of a group project at the UvA in which I implemented a visual interpretation of the 1 and 2D model for bird flocking.
