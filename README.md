An overview of projects I worked on:

- Vicszek Boids Model - Complex Systems: A part of a group project at the UvA in which I implemented a visual interpretation of the 1 and 2D model for bird flocking. 
- Bachelor Thesis Artificial Intelligence: a project about EA-optimization for Reservoir Networks.
